# Setup

This is a simple introduction to how I set up the tools and environment to work as a web developer. I will be using the following tools:

- [Windows PowerShell Preview](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p95zzktnrn4?hl=en-US&gl=US)
- [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
